\section{Introduction}
This paper aims to study how the emphasis of sentiments in training data can impact the performance of a sentiment analysis
model. The hypothesis is that having more emphasised emotions in training data can improve the performance of the resulting
model, even when running on less emphasised speech.

While sentiment analysis has existed for decades, existing research has primarily focused on
its use on text rather than speech. //TODO: Source

This review is incomplete however as it doesn't cover the impact of emphasis of emotions in training data.
Whilst researching this subject, no papers on the subject were found.
This could be due to the fact that speech sentiment analysis is a relatively new field of research. \cite{maghilnan_sentiment_2017}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Training Data}
Dialogue from the game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was used as training data for the model. //TODO: Why?
This game is known for its dialogue often being overacted, partly due to its actors being given
their lines in alphabetical order. //TODO: Source

The idea of using a video game as a corpus came from Hämäläinen et al.'s paper, \cite{hamalainen_video_2022}
In which the game Fallout New Vegas was used as training data with accuracies that
"... are rather low, but they are in line with the usual accuracies obtained in similar multilabel NLP
classification tasks" \cite[sec. 6]{hamalainen_video_2022}

Oblivion uses the same system in which every line of dialogue is annotated with a sentiment
and the game is voiced in the same five languages (English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish).
Each line of dialogue is annotated with one of 7 sentiments: anger, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised.

//TODO: How to test if the emphasis does anything. Need different data for that

//TODO: This
\subsection{Considerations}
//TODO: This. Lack of actor variety, copyright (maybe in results and discussion)

\subsection{Data Extraction}
//TODO: This. Mutagen or xEdit?

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Sentiment & Number of Samples \\ \hline
    Angry & \\ \hline
    Disgusted & \\ \hline
    Fearful & \\ \hline
    Happy & \\ \hline
    Neutral & \\ \hline
    Sad & \\ \hline
    Surprised & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Source Code}
//TODO: How to include this?
