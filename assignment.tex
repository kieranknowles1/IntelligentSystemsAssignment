\section{Introduction}
This paper aims to study how the emphasis of sentiments in training data can impact the performance of a sentiment analysis
model. The hypothesis is that having more emphasised emotions in training data can improve the performance of the resulting
model, even when running on less emphasised speech.

While sentiment analysis has existed for decades, existing research has primarily focused on
its use on text rather than speech. //TODO: Source

This review is incomplete however as it doesn't cover the impact of emphasis of emotions in training data.
Whilst researching this subject, no papers on the subject were found.
This could be due to the fact that speech sentiment analysis is a relatively new field of research. \cite{maghilnan_sentiment_2017}

\section{Literature Review}

//TODO: This

As the purpose of this study was to determine how the emphasis of speech affects
the performance of a model, only the audio from the training data was used as input,
for the model despite hybrid models being more accurate. \cite{bhaskar_hybrid_2015}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Model}
//TODO: This

\subsection{Training Data}
Dialogue from the game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was used as training data for the model. //TODO: Why?
This game is known for its dialogue often being overacted, partly due to its actors being given
their lines in alphabetical order. //TODO: Source

The idea of using a video game as training data came from Hämäläinen et al.'s paper, \cite{hamalainen_video_2022}
In which the game Fallout New Vegas was used as training data with accuracies that
"... are rather low, but they are in line with the usual accuracies obtained in similar multilabel NLP
classification tasks" \cite[sec. 6]{hamalainen_video_2022}

Oblivion uses the same system in which every line of dialogue is annotated with a sentiment
and the game is voiced in the same five languages (English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish).
Each line of dialogue is annotated with one of 7 sentiments: anger, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised.

//TODO: How to test if the emphasis does anything. Need different data for that

//TODO: This
\subsection{Considerations}
//TODO: This. Lack of actor variety, copyright (maybe in results and discussion)

Some lines of dialogue have actor notes which provided additional context to
the voice actors. These notes may lead actors to show a sentiment that does not
match the emotion annotated in the dialogue itself.

Additionally, the neutral emotion is the default emotion for any new line in the editor.
Because of this, some lines were never annotated with a sentiment despite the recorded
dialogue showing emotion. See table \ref{table:bad_annotation}

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{| c | l |}
        \hline
        Text & Don't try to manipulate me. \\ \hline
        Annotation & Neutral \\ \hline
        File & oblivion.esm\textbackslash nord\textbackslash f\textbackslash generic\textunderscore admirehate\textunderscore 00062311\textunderscore 1.mp3 \\ \hline
        Actual emotion & Anger \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{An example of a lines annotation not matching the recording}
    \label{table:bad_annotation}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data Extraction}
Due to the instability of Fallout New Vegas' official tools as reported by Hämäläinen et al., \cite{hamalainen_video_2022},
which was assumed to be the same for Oblivion, the data was instead extracted using a custom script
written using the Mutagen library. \cite{noauthor_mutagen_2023}
This script outputs a CSV file containing the dialogue, the sentiment, and its extracted file path.

See table \ref{table:category_counts} for a breakdown of the number of samples in each category.
