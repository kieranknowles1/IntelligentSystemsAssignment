	abstract = {We present a method for extracting a multilingual sentiment annotated dialog data set from Fallout New Vegas. The game developers have preannotated every line of dialog in the game in one of the 8 different sentiments: {\textbackslash}textit\{anger, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, pained, sad \} and {\textbackslash}textit\{surprised\}. The game has been translated into English, Spanish, German, French and Italian. We conduct experiments on multilingual, multilabel sentiment analysis on the extracted data set using multilingual BERT, XLMRoBERTa and language specific BERT models. In our experiments, multilingual BERT outperformed XLMRoBERTa for most of the languages, also language specific models were slightly better than multilingual BERT for most of the languages. The best overall accuracy was 54 percent and it was achieved by using multilingual BERT on Spanish data. The extracted data set presents a challenging task for sentiment analysis. We have released the data, including the testing and training splits, openly on Zenodo. The data set has been shuffled for copyright reasons.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis has evolved over past few decades, most of the work in it revolved around textual sentiment analysis with text mining techniques. But audio sentiment analysis is still in a nascent stage in the research community. In this proposed research, we perform sentiment analysis on speaker discriminated speech transcripts to detect the emotions of the individual speakers involved in the conversation. We analyzed different techniques to perform speaker discrimination and sentiment analysis to find efficient algorithms to perform this task.},
